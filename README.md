## 🔧 Technical Details

### Mixin Integration

The mod uses Fabric Mixin to intercept:
- `AbstractClientPlayerEntity.getSkinTexture()` - Returns custom texture identifier
- `AbstractClientPlayerEntity.isSlim()` - Returns custom slim model flag

### Texture Management

- Custom skins are loaded as `NativeImage` and converted to `NativeImageBackedTexture`
- Textures are registered with unique identifiers: `felixskin:dynamic/{player-uuid}`
- Old textures are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### GLFW Integration

- Uses GLFW drop callback to receive file drops from the OS
- Safely handles file path encoding and validation
- Only accepts PNG files with reasonable size limits

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Mod not loading**: Ensure you have the correct Fabric Loader version
2. **K key not working**: Check if the key binding conflicts with other mods
3. **Skin not applying**: Verify the PNG file is valid and not corrupted
4. **Performance issues**: Large HD skins (>2048x2048) may impact performance

### Logs

Check the Minecraft logs for any error messages. The mod logs important events with the prefix `[FelixSkin]`.
